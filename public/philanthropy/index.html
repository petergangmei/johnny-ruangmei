                <h4>Global Peace & Philanthropy</h4>
                <p>My journey has always been guided by a vision of global peace—a vision that intertwines my commitment to disaster management with a deep-seated passion for humanitarian service. I have dedicated my career to not only safeguarding communities but also fostering unity and resilience on a global scale.</p>
                <p>In my role as an Officer on Special Duty, at the rank of Deputy Secretary with the Government of Nagaland, I lead a division within the Nagaland State Disaster Management Authority. This position has afforded me the opportunity to develop and implement strategies that mitigate disaster risks while nurturing a culture of peace and cooperation.</p>
                <p>My experience with the United Nations Development Programme, where I served as a Project Officer in the Disaster Management Division, further reinforced my belief in the power of proactive disaster risk reduction. Supporting technical initiatives in this capacity allowed me to witness firsthand how well-coordinated efforts can lay the foundation for a more harmonious and resilient society.</p>
                <p>With a Master's in Social Work from Loyola College, Chennai, my academic background has played a crucial role in shaping my approach to global peace. It instilled in me the importance of empathy, community empowerment, and strategic action—principles that continue to guide my philanthropic endeavors.</p>
                <p>Every initiative I undertake is a step toward a future where communities not only overcome challenges but also thrive in an environment of sustained peace and solidarity.</p>
